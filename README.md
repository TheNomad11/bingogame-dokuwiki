# An experimental Bingo plugin for Dokuwiki

Developed with the assistance of ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai. I'm still conducting some testing.

A simple interactive Bingo-style listening exercise plugin for DokuWiki. 
Learners click on words in the correct order as they hear them read aloud. Works well for language classes as an engaging listening activity.

## Features

- Insert a 3×3 or 4×4 Bingo grid into any wiki page.
- Students click on the words in the order they hear them.
- Words are placed randomly in the grid each time.
- A score counter tracks how many correct clicks are made.
- When a row is completed, a sound effect is played.
- Fully responsive: works on desktop and mobile.
